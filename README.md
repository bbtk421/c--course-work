# C# Projects

These are some small projects I made in C# and .NET Framework/Core. Through my studies I become
familiar to proficient in Databases via SQL and Enitity and the creation of MVC applications.
This repository has literally every assignment and challenge I have done during the C# course.

## Projects:

* [Car Insurance](https://github.com/bbtk421/c--course-work/tree/master/basic_c%23/CarInsurance)
* [Live Project Placeholder]()

## Car Insurance

```html
This project is an MVC web Application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes the user's input 
on policy information and generates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that 
allows staff to view all quotes that have been issued.
```

## Live Project Placeholder

```html
Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Obcaecati natus, iste accusamus nihil libero 
quam ipsa atque vitae facilis perferendis consectetur sapiente ullam dolore odit temporibus, modi facere
harum? Vitae pariatur unde veniam itaque minima recusandae a earum temporibus nihil.
```
