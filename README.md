# C# Projects

These are some small projects I made in C# and .NET Framework/Core.

## Projects:

* [Car Insurance](https://github.com/bbtk421/c--course-work/tree/master/basic_c%23/CarInsurance)
* [Live Project Placeholder]()

## Car Insurance

```html
This project is an MVC web Application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes the user's input on policy information 
and generates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all quotes that have 
been issued.
```

## Live Project Placeholder

```html
Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Obcaecati natus, iste accusamus nihil libero quam ipsa atque vitae 
facilis perferendis consectetur sapiente ullam dolore odit temporibus, modi facere harum? Vitae pariatur unde veniam itaque 
minima recusandae a earum temporibus nihil.
```
